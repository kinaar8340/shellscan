# Phosphor Loom — one-page spec

**Sculpture:** The Realism Interface  
**Subtitle:** a 3D CRT  
**Crate:** `shellscan`  
**New noun:** `qga_pixel`

This is a thin scene crate in the inner_cone pattern. It does not own the frame, the observer, or the faceplate mesh.

## Claims

| Sentence | Label |
|---|---|
| The Hopf fibration \(S^3\to S^2\) exists. A plane cutting a double cone traces ellipse, parabola, hyperbola, or a degenerate pair of lines. | **Theorem** (cited) |
| Dual-cone observer (visual cyan \(+Z\), feeling orange, \(\pi/2\) about \(X\)). Four flux kinds are color classes. Trajectoid shell is the faceplate. Odd field writes the visual cone; even field writes the feeling cone. Separator torus is blanking. Persistence is mote age, not an RGB fade. | **Model** |
| `qga_gpu` owns the frame. Loom writes. Particle records are 32 bytes. `static_uploads` / `live_fiber_writes` / `particle_skipped` are upload counters. RGB in the particle shader is a witness projection. | **Software fact** |
| Two-clock interlacing on those cones will read as a display rather than a particle demo. | **Hypothesis, tested: not visible at sculpture distance.** Occupancy, rails (`ε=0.02R`), and locked tick (`tick.mp4`) all collapsed to one necklace. Clocks live in the ledger. Gun off. |

If a sentence cannot wear one of those four tags, it does not belong here.

Keep this file and `README.md` as the doors. VISION / TESTIMONY / NEST / SIGN / ATLAS / PHASE5 live in `docs/archive/`.

## Ownership (do not collapse)

| Layer | Owner |
|---|---|
| Algebra / Hopf / IslandType | [qga](https://github.com/kinaar8340/qga) / [qga_engine](https://github.com/kinaar8340/qga_engine) `qga-math` |
| Frame, loom, particles, capture | [qga_gpu](https://github.com/kinaar8340/qga_gpu) |
| Observer, cones, separator, `FluxMote.far_age` | [inner_cone](https://github.com/kinaar8340/inner_cone) |
| Trajectoid mesh, trench, fingerprint | [flux_trajectoid](https://github.com/kinaar8340/flux_trajectoid) |
| `qga_pixel` record + two-clock write | **this crate** |

## Machine

\[
\text{observer } S^2 \to \text{dual cones} \to \text{inverse-Hopf loom} \to \text{qga\_pixel field on a trajectoid shell} \to \text{two-clock persistence} \to \text{eye}
\]

Keep: faceplate, `qga_pixel` record, occupancy 256, rails `ε=0.02R` as data, packed `layer:8` as bits.  
Drop: gun on, more stills, bigger `ε`, bigger \(\Delta R\), smaller splat, Philogb gallery, clocks as a picture, nested stack as a picture, four flux kinds composited on \(\gamma\).  
Do not spend another commit proving the same collapse. The loom clip is the elliptic cell of Fig 6.1. Clone four isolated presets in `qga_gpu`, not on this faceplate. See [ATLAS.md](ATLAS.md).

## Palette (do not invent a fifth)

| Section | inner_cone kind | hue (`GpuParticle.pad`) |
|---|---|---|
| elliptic | `FluxKind::Elliptic` | 0.55 cyan |
| parabolic | `FluxKind::Parabolic` | 0.10 gold |
| hyperbolic | `FluxKind::Hyperbolic` | 0.30 orange |
| degenerate / flat-pocket | `FluxKind::FlatPockets` | 0.80 magenta |

## Phases

0. This page.  
1. `qga_pixel` 32-byte record. Encode section, Hopf address, field bit. Project RGB for the witness camera. **No scene.**  
2. Two-clock write. Clock 0 static / even / feeling. Clock 1 live / odd / visual. Persistence difference must be measurable.  
3. **Shipped.** Bind + window. Offline trench, 4k elliptic, `pos = γ(shell_s)`. Headless 8-frame: `SU=1`, `LF=0`, `PS=0`, `even=1347.844`, `odd=1872.004`, `both=3219.883`. `demo-tiny`-scale window. Gun off.  
4. **Closed.** Testimony. Faceplate pass, clock fail, gun deferred. Occupancy + rails + locked tick (`tick.mp4`) did not make clocks a picture. `LF=0`. See [TESTIMONY.md](TESTIMONY.md).  
5. **Closed (v1).** Sidecar write. Loopback BER 0; `generic_512` package (`shell_s=0.5`, trench `746a79b8…`). HITL not v1. Tip `2e1fe9c`. See [PHASE5.md](PHASE5.md). Not a window. Not a gun.  
6. **Picker (writer).** Sibling binary `make pick`. Emits a 32-byte `QgaPixel` (and JSON). Hemisphere sets \((\theta,\phi)\). Lock-to-4 on. One optional fiber arc. Does not own the faceplate window. Not a Philogb restyle. Not a second loom.  
7. **Closed.** Nested faceplates. Ledger pass (`sep=0.080`, energy \(256+256+256\)). Hypothesis **tested: not visible in composition.** Same collapse as rails, now in radius. Packed `layer:8` is true, not a draw license. Tip `95175f3`. See [NEST.md](NEST.md).

## Freeze (after Phase 5 v1)

| Slot | State |
|---|---|
| Faceplate + bind | Frozen |
| Clocks as a picture | Falsified, do not re-prove |
| Picker as writer | Frozen |
| SLM sidecar + loopback + `generic_512` | Frozen |
| HITL / Pluto / VPL-HW20A | Not v1 |
| Gun | Off |
| Animation A (scan head) | Unfrozen — hypothesis. See [SCAN.md](SCAN.md). |
| Nested shells / ShellCube | Falsified in composition, do not re-prove. Packed `layer:8` stays. See [NEST.md](NEST.md). |
| `vision_tracker` | Calibration + well `step()` in the sidecar. Bench RMS is the solver, not a lens. Scan A does not consume `site`. See [VISION.md](VISION.md). |
| Sign / antipode mask | Wired on SLM seed (`--mask`). Loopback unmasked. Faceplate does not draw it. See [SIGN.md](SIGN.md). |
| Fig 6.1 four-preset clone | Paper in `qga_gpu`, not this crate. Faceplate stays elliptic. See [ATLAS.md](ATLAS.md). |
| Recipe sidecar | Scored off \(\gamma(s)\). T=3 field strip and cylinder isoline are sidecar MP4s, not Animation A. inner_cone owns the observer; it is not a verb of `make film`. Atlas stop. Not a faceplate verb. See [RECIPE.md](RECIPE.md). |

`make scan` is the only unfrozen faceplate verb: one head on layer 0, other layers dark. `make recipe` / `make film` do not touch \(\gamma(s)\). Tracker writes `calib.json` / `gaze.json`; the faceplate does not read them. `--webcam` stays off. Do not fold `gaze.json` into `pick` or `demo`. N1 is a ledger, not a radial graphic. Do not raise \(\Delta R\). Do not shrink splat. Do not instance more shells. Do not grow a 33rd byte. `LF` still 0. Do not open `preview_montage.png`. Do not fold the phase stack into `pick` or `demo`. Do not treat `field=1` as a visible tick. Do not grow \(\varepsilon\) or turn the gun on. B (picker \(\psi\)) and C (two heads) are not this target. Fig 6.1 four-preset clone lives in `qga_gpu`, not here. Faceplate stays elliptic. Nothing else unfreezes.

## First scene (Phase 3, shipped)

One window. No mosaic. One observer. Two cones. One separator. One shell. 4k elliptic motes on `γ(s)`. Two clocks (interlace every frame; `live_every = 30`; gun off). HUD: field bit, `ELLIPTIC`, `SU` / `LF` / `PS`. Orbit camera only. `static_uploads == 1`.
